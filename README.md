My account uses my personal email and my username is Spoocyy
My repository is Spoocyy.github.io
First I opened GitHub Desktop, which already had the cloning a repository up. I then clicked the repository I wanted to copy and made sure I was under GitHub.com. Then I made sure the file location was what I wanted it to be. Finally I clicked the clone button at the bottom and it successfully copied my repository to my files.
